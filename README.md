### [Example API](https://github.com/kevupton/example-laravel-coinpayments)

### Require

```
composer require kevupton/laravel-coinpayments
```

### 1. Install Service Provider

```php
// add directly from the app 
$app->register(\Oasin\LaravelCoinpayments\Providers\LaravelCoinpaymentsServiceProvider::class);
```

OR

All service providers are registered in the `config/app.php` configuration file.
```php
'providers' => [
    // Other Service Providers

    \Oasin\LaravelCoinpayments\Providers\LaravelCoinpaymentsServiceProvider::class,
],
```

### 2. Configure

`.env` configuration
```text
COINPAYMENTS_DB_PREFIX=cp_
COINPAYMENTS_MERCHANT_ID=your_unique_merchant_id
COINPAYMENTS_PUBLIC_KEY=generated_public_key
COINPAYMENTS_PRIVATE_KEY=generated_private_key
COINPAYMENTS_IPN_SECRET=your_custom_ipn_secret
COINPAYMENTS_IPN_URL=your_ipn_url
COINPAYMENTS_API_FORMAT=json
COINPAYMENTS_IPN_ROUTE_ENABLED=true
COINPAYMENTS_IPN_ROUTE_PATH=/api/ipn
```

*Execute `php artisan vendor:publish` for the complete config file.*

Config: `coinpayments.php`
```php

return array(

    // prefix to each of the tables in the database
    'database_prefix' => env('COINPAYMENTS_DB_PREFIX', 'cp_'),

    'merchant_id' => env('COINPAYMENTS_MERCHANT_ID'),

    // Your API public key associated with your coinpayments account
    'public_key' => env('COINPAYMENTS_PUBLIC_KEY'),

    // Your API private key associated with your coinpayments account
    'private_key' => env('COINPAYMENTS_PRIVATE_KEY'),

    // This is used to verify that an IPN is from us, use a good random string nobody can guess.
    'ipn_secret' => env('COINPAYMENTS_IPN_SECRET'),

    // URL for your IPN callbacks. If not set it will use the IPN URL in your Edit Settings page if you have one set.
    'ipn_url' => env('COINPAYMENTS_IPN_URL'),

    // The format of response to return, json or xml. (default: json)
    'format' => env('COINPAYMENTS_API_FORMAT', 'json'),

    // ALL logs all requests, ERROR logs only errors, and NONE never
    'log_level' => Log::LEVEL_ERROR,
    
    // Whether or not to have coinpayments automatically parse IPN's for you. If so please specify a PATH
    'route'           => [
        'enabled' => env('COINPAYMENTS_IPN_ROUTE_ENABLED', false),
        'path'    => env('COINPAYMENTS_IPN_ROUTE_PATH', '/api/ipn'),
    ],
);

```

### 3. Setup Database

Run the migration to install the database tables
```shell
php artisan migrate
```

### 4. Usage

Simple Transaction
```php
$transaction = \Coinpayments::createTransactionSimple($cost, $currency_base, $currency_received, $extra_details);
```
Callback Address
```php
$callbackAddress = \Coinpayments::getCallbackAddress($currency);
```
Withdrawal
```php
$withdrawal = \Coinpayments::createWithdrawal($amount, $currency, $address, true);
```
Mass Withdrawal - *Uses the same values for withdrawal, but in an array*
```php
$mass_withdrawal = \Coinpayments::createMassWithdrawal([
    [
        'amount' => $amount1,
        'address' => $address1,
        'currency' => $currency1,
    ],
    [
        'amount' => $amount2,
        'address' => $address2,
        'currency' => $currency2,
    ],
]);
```
Convert Coins
```php
$conversion = \Coinpayments::convertCoins($amount, $from, $to, $address = null);
```
Withdrawal Info
```php
$info = \Coinpayments::getWithdrawalInfo($id);
```
Conversion Info
```php
$info = \Coinpayments::getConversionInfo($id);
```

#### IPN validation
Laravel Coinpayments can automatically handle IPN's for you:
Just specify, the path and enable it using the env variables.

```
COINPAYMENTS_IPN_ROUTE_ENABLED=true
COINPAYMENTS_IPN_ROUTE_PATH=/api/ipn
```

You can just subscribe to the Model events using an event listening on the following events:
###### Deposit - When someone deposits money to a callback address
- DepositCreated - When a deposit has been created
- DepositUpdated - When a deposit has been updated, but not complete.
- DepositComplete - When a deposit has completed (after all of the confirms have been received)

##### Withdrawal - When you make a withdrawal from the API
- WithdrawalCreated
- WithdrawalUpdated
- WithdrawalComplete

##### Transaction - When you make a transaction from the API
- TransactionCreated
- TransactionUpdated
- TransactionComplete

Then just subscribe to the event by adding a listener to the `App\Providers\EventServiceProvider`:
```php
    /**
     * The event listener mappings for the application.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $listen = [
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
        Kevupton\LaravelCoinpayments\Events\Deposit\DepositComplete::class => [
            \App\Listeners\DoSomethingOnDepositListener::class, // your own class listener for when a deposit is created
=======
        Oasin\LarvelCoinpayments\Events\Deposit\DepositCompleted::class => [
            App\Listeners\DoSomethingOnDepositListener::class, // your own class listener for when a deposit is created
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
        ],
    ];
```
Then you can just do the same for each event.

Example event listener:
```php
<?php

namespace App\Listeners;

use Oasin\LaravelCoinpayments\Events\Deposit\DepositComplete;

class DoSomethingOnDepositListener
{

    /**
    * Handler for the DepositComplete event. 
    * Here we can do anything with the completed deposit object.
    */
    public function handle(DepositComplete $depositComplete)
    {
        var_dump($depositComplete->deposit->toArray());
    }

}

```

#### Manual Approach to IPNS:

```php
try {
    $ipn = \Coinpayments::validateIPNRequest($request);
    
    // do soemthing with the completed IPN
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    
    // transaction not completed.
}
```

### 4.1 Example Controller

CoinPayments Controller
```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Oasin\LaravelCoinpayments\Exceptions\IpnIncompleteException;
use Oasin\LaravelCoinpayments\Models\Ipn;
use Oasin\LaravelCoinpayments\Models\Transaction;

class CoinpaymentsController extends Controller
{
    const ITEM_CURRENCY = 'BTC';
    const ITEM_PRICE    = 0.01;

    /**
     * Purchase items using coinpayments payment processor
     *
     * @param Request $request
     * @return array
     */
    public function purchaseItems (Request $request)
    {
        // validate that the request has the appropriate values
        $this->validate($request, [
            'currency' => 'required|string',
            'amount'   => 'required|integer|min:1',
        ]);


        $amount   = $request->get('amount');
        $currency = $request->get('currency');

        /*
         * Calculate the price of the item (qty * ppu)
         */
        $cost = $amount * self::ITEM_PRICE;

        /** @var Transaction $transaction */
        $transaction = \Coinpayments::createTransactionSimple($cost, self::ITEM_CURRENCY, $currency);

        return ['transaction' => $transaction];
    }

    /**
     * Creates a donation transaction
     *
     * @param Request $request
     * @return array
     */
    public function donation (Request $request)
    {
        // validate that the request has the appropriate values
        $this->validate($request, [
            'currency' => 'required|string',
            'amount'   => 'required|integer|min:0.01',
        ]);

        $amount   = $request->get('amount');
        $currency = $request->get('currency');

        /*
         * Here we are donating the exact amount that they specify.
         * So we use the same currency in and out, with the same amount value.
         */
        $transaction = \Coinpayments::createTransactionSimple($amount, $currency, $currency);

        return ['transaction' => $transaction];
    }

    /**
     * Handled on callback of IPN
     *
     * @param Request $request
     */
    public function validateIpn (Request $request)
    {
        try {
            /** @var Ipn $ipn */
            $ipn = \Coinpayments::validateIPNRequest($request);

            // if the ipn came from the API side of coinpayments merchant
            if ($ipn->isApi()) {

                /*
                 * If it makes it into here then the payment is complete.
                 * So do whatever you want once the completed
                 */

                // do something here
                // Payment::find($ipn->txn_id);
            }
        }
        catch (IpnIncompleteException $e) {
            $ipn = $e->getIpn();
            /*
             * Can do something here with the IPN model if desired.
             */
        }
    }
}
```

### 5. Logging

Adjust the logging in the config file by selecting either `LEVEL_NONE`, `LEVEL_ERROR` or `LEVEL_ALL`.

Logs will be saved into the database under `$prefix . 'log'`.
